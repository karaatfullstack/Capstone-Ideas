## Wix clone

#### Overview
Wix is a website builder that allows users with little or no coding experience to build a website using a simple UI to select HTML elements, and drag/drop/resize them and give them content. These designs can then be saved and published as webpages. 

#### MVP
A user should be able to drag and drop a visual representation of an HTML element onto a canvas. The user can then resize this element, give it content, and preview the created page. [Reference project][https://github.com/bowserdnd/divlab]

#### Technical Challenges
* Serializing and deserializing the information representing the created webpage. 
* Drag and drop functionality
* Integrating third part libraries with React

#### Stretch Goals
* Snap-to-fit grid to allow more exact layouts
* CSS customizations
* Widgets that execute javscript (e.g. a signup form)
