# SQL Query Builder

## Overview
Create a non-technical GUI for building SQL queries.

## MVP
Users should be able to create advanced SQL queries (including joins) through an easy-to-use GUI. After submitting a query, the application should display the resulting data in a meaningful format.

## Stretch Goals
* Provide the user suggestions as they build the query (eg. suggest that they perform a SUM on a column with numerical values)
* Allow users to save their queries
* Return data results as visualizations

## Technical Challenges
* Understanding advanced SQL queries
* Serializing user input and converting it into SQL
* Building an intuitive user interface
