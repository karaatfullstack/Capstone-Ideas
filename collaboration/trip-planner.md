* Users can add tasks for things that need to planned with a due date
* Users can assign individuals to tasks
* Yelp / TripAdvisor or similar third party API integration to assist in finding places to eat or excursions
* Follow up reminders, either in-app or through some third-party service, when incomplete tasks are close to the due date
* Logging of historic trips for future reference
* Map feature to plot trip events


#### Stretch Goals

* View to see the proposed itinerary as events for trip are confirmed
* Integration with google calendar
* Chat functionality to discuss plans
* For tasks that each person needs to do (i.e. book plane tickets or if plan is to go sailing one day, purchase a ticket for a sailing cruise), confirmation that everyone completed the task
* Voting feature if there are disagreements on what to do during the trip
* Social aspect where users can have add friends and view their friendsâ€™ past trips for ideas
* Collecting photo / video / audio during the trip


#### Technical Challenges

* Third party integration
* Real-time updating
* Intuitive UI / UX
* Storing sequence of events in a trip
