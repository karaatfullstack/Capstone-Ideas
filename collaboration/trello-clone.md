# Collaboration

## Trello Clone

#### Overview
Implement your own version of [Trello](https://trello.com/).

#### MVP

* Users can create and save project boards.
* Users can add others to their board.
* Users can create new tasks and move them across the board.

#### Stretch Goals 

* Click and drag functionality.
* Tasks can have tags that the users can then use to filter or search.
* Integrate your app with another productivity app such as Slack.

#### Technical Challenges

* Managing users' access to boards.
* Abstracting the logic for boards to allow for any number of columns or tasks.
* Creating user-friendly forms.
