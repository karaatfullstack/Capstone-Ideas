# Event Consensus Coordinator

#### Overview

Getting people to decide on when / where / how to meet up is the worst. Solve this.

#### MVP

Users should be able to create groups and invite others to participate in not only discussion, but also consensus formation. This should include time, location, and notes. 

- Once an event has been planned, users should be able to somehow follow-up with reminders, either in-app or through some third-party service (e.g. by adding the event to a calendar application).

#### Stretch Goals

* Polling features
* Event prep todos
* Integration with third party services, like calendars, social media sites, task managers, etc.
* Robust communication layer: the app can accept input (and maybe give output) via text messaging, email, in-app messages, etc. based on user preferences
* Collecting photo / video / audio / text during an event
* Mobile app (e.g. with react native)
* Recurring events

#### Technical Challenges

* Potential for extreme variety of third-party integrations
* Modeling open-ended, chaotic human processes
* Real-time updating
* Accomodating different device types
