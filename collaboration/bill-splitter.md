## Bill Splitter

#### Overview

Make bill splitting easier by building a mobile application that will use a receipt image to do the splitting for you.

#### MVP

* Users can take/upload a picture of a receipt through the app
* The app will detect the text on the receipt and parse out each item name and total
* Users can enter friends at the table and assign them to items on the receipt

#### Stretch Goals

* Multiple splitting options (per item, split evenly)
* Text/email notifications
* Payment integration (ie: Stripe, Venmo, PayPal, etc)
* Track payments (keep running totals on how much each friend owes, mark when paid)

#### Technical Challenges

* Image processing
* Mobile-friendly
