# Mobile-Focused Apps

## Pocket Clone

#### Overview
Souped-up "bookmarks" app focused on an uncluttered, uniform reading experience

#### Technical Challenges
* Web Scraping
* Offline reading (PWA)
* Browser extensions

#### Stretch Goals
* Social: sharing, following
* Recommendations specific to users based on past activity
* Data visualizations of reading habits
