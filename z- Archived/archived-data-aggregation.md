# Data Aggregation / Visualization Applications

## Easy Viz (Graphiti Clone)

#### Overview
This application is for easing the problem of figuring out what kind of graph is best and how do I graph my data? Stretch versions of this application further simplify this process by allowing users to easily search for data.

#### MVP
A user should be able to upload and/or easily search for data. A user should be able to select column(s) they are interested in and your application should graph the most appropriate graph for that dataset.

#### Stretch Goals
* A user should be able to manipulate the graphs they make.
* Your app should be able to generate scatterplots, line graphs, bar graphs, histograms, and/or pie charts. 
* A user should be able to plot 3 or more columns.
* A user should be able to save their create graphs.
* A user should be able to share their created graphs.
