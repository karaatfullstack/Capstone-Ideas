## Educational Scavenger Hunt

#### Overview
An educational, mobile-based scavenger hunt to help users learn more about a given locations. This can be for new students on campus, tourists visiting interesting locations in the city, or patrons at a museum. Users should be presented with clues, and have some means of verifying when they have reached the desired goal or location. Users should be able to track their progress and compete or work together with others. 


#### MVP
A player is given a nearby location. They may receive points when submitting their phone's lat/lng coordinates at the proper place or a picture of a desired landmark. 


#### Technical Challenges
- Geospatial APIs
- Image Recognition
- Mobile Development
- PWA/Native development

#### Stretch Goals
- Games are timed and support multiplayer. 
- A high-score board exists for elite players.
- Data viz dashboard that updates with player stats and previous missions
- Admins can create and submit their own scav hunts.
- Augmented Reality (visual, twilio, etc)
