## Codenames

#### Overview
You will be building an web-based version of the board game Codenames ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game))). Players can start a game, invite their friends, form teams, and play in real time.

#### MVP
Your users should be able to
* Create a game instance and invite friends by sharing a URL.
* Group into teams (manually or automatically)
* Generate a grid of cards, each with a unique word
* Send chat messages to each other (individually or to all players)
* If they are the Spymaster, send one word and one number on their team's turn
* See a turn timer counting down, synced between all players

#### Stretch Goals
Users can
* Choose to play with an AI Spymaster (good chance to look into natural language processing)
* Chat with each other over video (or voice-only)

#### Technical Challenges
* Socket state management
* Game Logic
* Animations
